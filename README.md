## <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/tree/main/common">Common Folder</a> <br>
* <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/common/constants.py">Constants</a> <br>
   - Set paths, model, hyperparameters, and other needed constants.
<br>

* <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/common/functions.py">Functions</a> <br>
   - Support functions to: Create model, compile model, split the dataset, numpy to tensorflow dataset transformations, majority vote, etc.
<br>

* <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/common/confusion_matrix.py">Confusion Matrix</a> <br>
   - Take the majority vote, after the model is trained, and create a confusion matrix, by patient.
<br>
<br>

## <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/data_preperation.py">Data Preperation</a> <br>
   * Reading data ilteratively and stores them in 3 numpy files: <br>
     - x: Array of shape (-1, 1000, 19) for patient's data. So, basically a list of 2d arrays: 1000 datapoints (2 seconds-segment) for 19 channels. <br>
     - y: Array of shape (-1) that tracks the labels for each 2-second data segment. <br>
     - z: Array of shape (-1) that tracks the patient ID for each 2-second data segment. <br>

<br>

## <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/model_train_segments.py">Model Train: By Segment</a> <br>
   - Reads the numpy files created from data_preperation.py <br>
   - Splits them into train and test data, 80-20, in a balanced way, in terms of labels in train and test sets. <br>
   - Reads the model from functions.py <br>
   - Train it. <br>
   
<br>

## <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/model_train_patient_6fold.py">Model Train: By Patient - 6 Fold</a> <br>
   - Reads the numpy files created from data_preperation.py <br>
   - Splits them into train and test data, 80-20, by patient, in a balanced way. That means that segments of the same patient cannot exist on both train and test set. <br>
   - Reads the model from functions.py <br>
   - Trains it. <br>

<br>

## <a href="https://github.com/ggkenios/eeg-diagnosis/blob/main/model_train_patient_leave1out.py">Model Train: By Patient - Leave 1 Out</a> <br>
   - Reads the numpy files created from data_preperation.py <br>
   - Splits them into train and test data, leaving one patient out at a time. <br>
   - Reads the model from functions.py <br>
   - Trains it. <br>
