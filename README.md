<br>

### Data Preparation

* <a href="https://github.com/Ggkenios/thesis/blob/main/data_preperation.py">Data Preperation</a> <br>
   - Reading data ilteratively and stores them in 3 numpy files: <br>
      x: Array of shape (-1, 1000, 19) for patient's data. So, basically a list of 2d arrays: 1000 datapoints (2 seconds-window) for 19 channels. <br>
      y: Array of shape (-1) that tracks the labels for each 2-second data window. <br>
      z: Array of shape (-1) that tracks the patient ID for each 2-second data window. <br>

<br>

### Model Train
* <a href="https://github.com/Ggkenios/thesis/blob/main/model_train.py">Model Train</a> <br>
   - Reads the numpy files created from data_preperation.py
   - Splits them into train and test data, 80-20, in a balanced way, in terms of labels in train and test sets.
   - Creates a simple LSTM model with 128 units --> Batch Normalization --> Dense(64, activation="relu") --> Dense(3, activation="softmax")
   - Train it.

<br>

### Plots
* <a href="https://github.com/Ggkenios/thesis/blob/main/plots.py">Plots</a> <br>
   - Creates a confusion matrix plot for all patients.
